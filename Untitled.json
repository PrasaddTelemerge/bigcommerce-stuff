        "description": "Dab Rigs (also known as vapor rigs, concentrate rigs, concentrate pipes, or oil rigs) are a specific type of water pipe used for the consumption of essential oils, legal concentrates, and legal waxes. Vapor Rigs feature a joint (10mm, 14mm, or 18mm) and have a different process depending on the type of nail used. With a standard dome and nail, simply remove the dome and heat the nail with a butane torch. Place the dome back over the nail and use a dabber or dab tool to put the desired amount of concentrates on to the nail and inhale. A domeless nail requires the same process except with more convenience as there is no need to remove and replace the dome. The essential oils will vaporize due to the high temperature of the nail, and vapor will travel through the concentrate rig ready for smooth inhalation."

Features

Types of percs:

Diffused Downstem → This is the most simple design for a percolator. The glass straight tube has slits or holes at its base under the water which allows the smoke to cool down as it travels through it. 

Tree Perc → When it comes to tree percs, the more arms it has the more diffusion that can happen, creating a larger separation of the smoke. The arms of the tree usually have slits on the side, and constructed with either a closed or open bottom. Smaller slits lead to smaller bubbles which results in more diffusion, filtration, and percolation

Disc Perc → Disc percolators are circular percs which resemble a disc. Disc percs have slits or holes for filtration and diffusion. They usually come in specific types such as turbine disc percs, honeycomb percs, or ratchet disc percs.
Turbine Disc Perc → Turbine disc percs are a type of diffusion system consisting of a solid disc of angled slits placed inside the water chamber. The angled slits create a spinning effect which both cools and diffuses the smoke while creating a unique visual effect. 
Crystal Ball Perc → Crystal ball percs are a circular perc with angled slits intertwining across it. Its shape and the intertwining slits make the perc appear like a crystal ball.
Dome Perc → Dome percolators are called this because of their shape. They have slits and holes where the dome touches the bottom. Diffusion happens when the smoke passes through the dome, and separates when going through the holes or slits.
Barrel Perc → Barrel percolators are a specific type of dome perc. They have more slits than a traditional dome perc, while the inner chamber isn't as large which creates less drag.
Showerhead Perc → Showerhead percolators have a thin vertical tube that widens into a round chamber. They have slits or holes for increased filtration and diffusion. Their name comes from their resemblance to a showerhead.
Honeycomb Perc → Honeycomb percs are a type of disc perc, but they have more diffusion because they usually have at least 30 small holes through which the smoke must pass. The holes must be the correct size because large holes won't filter the smoke efficiently and small holes will create too much drag.
Ratchet Perc → Ratchet percs are a type of disc perc with holes lining the perimeter of the disc to increase filtration and the flow of smoke.
Waffle Perc → Waffle percs are similar to disc percs except they have holes rather than slits. Their appearance is similar to that of a waffle fry.
Matrix Perc → Matrix percs are a cylindrical chamber with vertical and horizontal slits or grooves.
Stereo Matrix Perc → Stereo matrix percs consist of two smaller matrix percolators stacked on top of each other. This usually occurs in larger water pipes with two chambers, where one matrix perc is housed in each chamber.
Reti Perc → Reti percolators consist of two cylinders, with a smaller one inside a larger one. Diffusion occurs when smoke passes through the slits of the cylinders.
UFO Perc → UFO percs feature a rounded top with a glass circle base. They have a series of slits around the circumference of the glass circle. Smoke passes through these slits to create serious diffusion and filtration. UFO percs are often sought after because of their efficiency and ease of cleaning.
Swiss Perc → Swiss percs are a vertical diffusion system with holes on a large disc. The name derives from the percolators resemblance to swiss cheese.
Inline Perc → Inline percolators are a straight perc composed of a slit or gridded tube inside a perpendicular chamber.
Stemline Perc → Stemline percs are a type of inline percolator that branches straight off of the joint.
Donut Perc → Donut percs are a circular perc that has a hole in the middle to provide extra filtering of the smoke and also stops water from splashing up towards the mouthpiece. This type of percolator gets its name because of it looks like a donut.
Cross Perc → Cross percs are one of the latest inventions from one of the leading percolator innovators out there, JM Flow. This percolator has an intricate design with a circular center with multiple circle pieces branching out from it. Each of these circles has slits in the form of a cross that leads to the most smoke filtration and a smoother hit for the smoker.
Inset Perc → Inset percs are contained inside the chamber of the water pipe and are an indented perc that creates a pocket. Inset percolators have slits around their circumference to filter and diffuse the smoke.
Circ Perc → A circ perc is a circular percolator that usually contains numerous rings with spacing between them. This spacing and the holes/slits of the perc allow for intense filtration.
Sprinkler Perc → A sprinkler perc is a circular perc featuring multiple tubes branching out in all directions. Similar to a tree perc, the smoke goes through the circular part and leaves out through the many different arms. The separation of the smoke/vapor causes filtration and diffusion for optimal pulls.
J-Hook Perc → A J-Hook perc gets its name because it has the shape of an upside-down J. It usually connects to a different type of perc and is generally houses in the upper chamber of a water pipe or concentrate rig.
Tongue Perc → A tongue perc resembles a tongue and its unique design has slits and holes to rigorously diffuse and filter vapor and smoke.
Thick Glass → This glass pipe contains thick glass which increases its durability and longevity. Thick glass pieces are less likely to break due to their heavy glass construction.

American Glass → This glass piece is certified to be hand blown right here in the USA. American glass has earned the reputation of being more reliable and of higher quality.

Bent neck → Bent neck designs offer aesthetic and functional qualities. Aesthetically, bent necks give a unique look to your glass water pipe. Functionally, bent necks act as a splashguard, keeping all of the water inside the pipe and outside of your mouth. They also extend the mouthpiece away from the heat source horizontally, giving a more comfortable experience. 

Straight Neck → Straight neck designs involve a neck branching vertically up into the mouthpiece from the chamber. They allow smoke or vapor to travel directly up to the mouthpiece.

Flared Mouthpiece → Flared mouthpieces have elevated glass around the mouthpiece which make it conform perfectly to your mouth for superior comfort while smoking.

Fab Egg → This piece has a faberge egg design. The fab egg chamber has a circular egg shape with a hollow center and holes that provide a distinguished design. The holes also function as a perfect holder for your dabber.

Straight Tube → This water pipe is a straight tube, meaning it has a straight and vertical design from the base to the mouthpiece. Many people prefer this style because of the seamless transition of your smoke/vapor from the joint to the mouthpiece.

Beaker → This glass pipe has a beaker base chamber. Beaker style water pipes generally have a wide circular main chamber to house a large amount of smoke. Many people prefer this style because of its attractive visual appearance. 

Sidecar → This piece contains a sidecar design. This means it has a neck that branches off the side of the chamber and leads to the mouthpiece. Sidecars eliminate splashback and ensure all of the water stays inside the pipe and out of your mouth.

Polished Joint → A polished joint is a joint made from clear glass instead of the standard frosted glass you find on most joints. A polished joint gives a sleek and refined appearance to any water pipe. 

90° Joint → A 90° joint gives a water pipe or concentrate pipe a uniform and clean look as it creates a 90° angle from the top to the chamber.
