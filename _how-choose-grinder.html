		<p>Herb grinders are a useful and convenient accessory when it comes to smoking dry herbs and tobacco. They break down your smoking blend into a manageable size that is suitable to be consumed in whatever manner you see fit. Grinders save you time, provide great transportability, and help create a discreet smoking environment. Although it is undoubtable that the appropriate grinder will enhance your smoking experience, the most important factor when shopping for a grinder is selecting one that caters to your specific wants and needs. With the constant expansion of smoking accessories as the industry continues to grow, we know that it can become complex and confusing when you see an array of grinders at an online headshop. We strongly believe that informed customers make the best decisions, which is precisely why we have broken down a list of characteristics that will guide you through purchasing a new grinder.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="grinder-size">
		<h2>Size</h2>
		<p>Grinders come in a variety of sizes, including mini, small, medium, large, and even extra large. The size of your grinder is crucial and all depends on what you prioritize when it comes to your accessories. The size of the grinder refers to how wide or how large the diameter of the grinder is. Are you an on-the-go smoker who values portability? Then look for a mini or a small grinder. Do you want something to keep around the house for when you need it? Look for an herb grinder that fits into the medium or large category. If you’re a heavy smoker who only smokes large amounts of tobacco or dry herbs, they manufacture extra large grinders just for you. Whatever your requisites for what you deem a successful smoking session, there’s a grinder sized just for your predilection. A grinder, like any smoking product or accessory, is an investment for many future uses over time. Make sure to think carefully about which size fits with your style before purchasing.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="grinder-material">
		<h2>Material</h2>
		<p>One of the most important factors in finding that perfect grinder is the material that it is crafted from. The most popular material you’ll come across is aluminum, although the quality and grade of the aluminum is also something that warrants consideration. Some manufacturers claim to use aluminum, when in fact it is an unknown combination of metallic substances. That’s why it is pivotal to purchase from a trusted company like Santa Cruz Shredder, DankStop, Sharpstone, or Dank Tools (just to name a few). These companies use high-grade aluminum when constructing their products. Other options besides aluminum include acrylic or wood. Grinders made from these materials will come with a lower price tag but are less durable and generally have a shorter lifespan. Keep this in mind when deciding which material is best for you.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="grinder-sections">
		<h2>Sections</h2>
		<p>Depending on the make and model, tobacco grinders will come with a differing amount of sections. The three most common models are two piece, three piece, and four piece grinders. Two piece grinders are the most simplistic and have just a lid and a tooth grinding section. Your smoking blend will stay in the same section that holds the grinding teeth. Three piece grinders are a bit more elaborate; with a top, a tooth section for your dry herbs, and an herb chamber. These grinders have the benefit of a separate area for your herbs, which is more convenient for the user since the ground up tobacco or herbs doesn’t get caught up in the teeth. The most functional of the three types of grinders is the four piece grinder. It has all of the attributes of a three piece grinder with an added section for a pollen catcher. The herb chamber has a screen at the bottom which allows herb dust, pollen, and extra shavings to fall into the pollen catcher. This allows you to let pollen stash up over time (so none of your herbs get wasted in the grinding process), and it also gives you the ability to come back later and utilize the pollen. One important detail to note is that naturally the more sections an herb grinder has, the larger the height. This differs from size as that refers to the diameter of the grinder. A four section grinder is going to have a slightly more bulky feel than a two piece grinder, and you have to weigh whether the superb added functionality is worth the volume difference.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="grinder-budget">
		<h2>Budget</h2>
		<p>Despite it being touched upon last, budget is one of the most important characteristics to consider before buying a new grinder. Every smoker has a different opinion on how crucial a grinder is to their smoking session, which directly correlates to how much they are willing to spend. A common misconception is that you need to spend a large sum of money in order to have a fully operating, highly practical, and extremely durable tobacco grinder. The growth of the smoking industry, which was briefly mentioned earlier, has created a causation of more accessories at an extremely affordable price point. More companies, such as DankStop and Dank Tools, are providing high-quality grinders with those on a budget in mind. These companies find a way to manufacture high grade aluminum grinders while keeping your wallet in mind. All of that being said, for those who are grinder enthusiasts there are plenty of options for renowned brands that use the latest technology and features. One brand that we highly recommend is Santa Cruz Shredder, who uses one piece of CNC aluminum to craft all of their grinders. They come with a higher price tag, but make up for it with their scratch resistant anodized finish, square teeth (to stop metal fatigue and to completely eradicate the possibility of aluminum flakes in your smoking blend), and other innovative features. As you can see, the options are endless and it really comes down to how much your budget is and how much value you see in a grinder as an accessory. Regardless of what you decide your budget to be, there are durable and efficient herb grinders available in all price ranges.</p>

		<p>Now that you have the appropriate information, you can rest assured that you’ll be able to find the perfect grinder that fits all of your qualifications as far as how you smoke, your price range, and the features you require for an optimal smoking experience. As long as you carefully consider the aforementioned attributes, finding the grinder that is ideal for you as an individual will be simple and straightforward.
