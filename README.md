====================

BigCommerce Projects - Plugins, Addons, Extensions, Features, and Custom Code for BigCommerce e-commerce Platform

Please provide quotes and time frames to complete each project.

##List of Projects  
1.  **Color Swatch on Category Pages**    
-- Some products have color options and in BigCommerce, these only show up on Product Pages,  We want them to also show up on category pages (I assume some javascript or something is necessary here).  Please give 2 prices, 1 price for just showing "Multiple color options available" when they are present, just showing up a thin overlay strip over the image thumbnail, and 2. where the actual color swatch shows up in a nicely integrated fashion into the category page listings.

2.  **Size Options On Category Pages**    
-- Similar to 1 except with Sizes.  Please also give 2 prices for this as well.

3.  **Alternate Thumbnail Images on Hover**    
-- On mouse hover, on Category and Brand pages, a 2nd, alternate thumbnail image should slide out from the left or right.

4.  **Product Page Videos**    
-- A button that will trigger a video to show up over the image of the product, and then disappears when the same button is clicked.  Should work on desktop and mobile.

5.  **Category Page Videos (is it extra for Brand pages?)**    
-- Similar to product page videos above, but on category pages.  Not each product should have the trigger button (on mobile, preferably in top right corner of image, on desktop preferably as one of the thumbnail images) but only for those for which we have uploaded videos to /content/videos/ folder on our WebDAV (or maybe some other method if you have a better one)

6.  **Product Page Brand Descriptions**  
-- Each product has a brand that is associated with it.  We want a little brand banner with a logo and description of the brand to automatically be added to product pages depending on what brand they are.  We can store the descriptions in some BC hidden page or some other file.

7.  **Category Page Out of Stock script**  
-- A javascript to put a little "Out of Stock" ribbon on the corner of a product listing on category pages when it is sold out.

8.  **Custom Field 1 + 2 appear on right in a table**  
-- We have some custom product properties such as "Height" and "Joint Type" and we want those to show up not int he product description on the bottom of the product page, but on the right of the product image where the other details of the product are.

9.  **Fix resizing issue on category pages when using BC admin panel "Show Newest" option**  
-- When we select "Show newest first" the sizing of the height of the product listings gets messed up.  Each row is supposed to be the height of the tallest product listing, and this gets messed up.

10.  **Install new slider on front page**  
-- The slider on front page only allows up to 4-6 images.  We want a new slider installed that has similar features but will allow many more images (up to 10 or more)

11.  **Implement swipeable "next" and "Prev" actions on Product Page images**  
-- On mobile product pages, the images must be selected by clicking the dots beneath the image.  We want the image to be changeable when a person swipes left or right on the image, bringing up the next or previous image in the list of images.   

12.  **Fix MagicZoom and the conflict it causes with video**  
-- messes up javascript.... breaks it because much of the jQuery-dependent JS written for the ProductThumb gets messed up due to "Undefined TypeError" cuases by missing HTML elements such as <div class="ProductThumb">
