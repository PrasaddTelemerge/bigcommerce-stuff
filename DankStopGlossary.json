      "aka": "concentrate pipe",
      "description": "Dab Rigs (also known as vapor rigs, concentrate rigs, concentrate pipes, or oil rigs) are a specific type of water pipe used for the consumption of essential oils, legal concentrates, and legal waxes. Vapor Rigs feature a joint (10mm, 14mm, or 18mm) and have a different process depending on the type of nail used. With a standard dome and nail, simply remove the dome and heat the nail with a butane torch. Place the dome back over the nail and use a dabber or dab tool to put the desired amount of concentrates on to the nail and inhale. A domeless nail requires the same process except with more convenience as there is no need to remove and replace the dome. The essential oils will vaporize due to the high temperature of the nail, and vapor will travel through the concentrate rig ready for smooth inhalation."

Unlike most grinder companies that use sharp teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder uses square teeth. Sharp-edged teeth dull from metal fatigue and contain burr and tiny flakes of aluminum that can fall into your smoking blend. By using square teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder avoids this extremely unhealthy possibility. The grinders are &#x3C;span&#x3E;fabricated out of a single piece of high grade CNC aluminum to provide durability and a consistent grind. Santa Cruz Shredder &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/grinders/&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;&#x3E;grinders&#x3C;/a&#x3E; are totally scratch resistant through a process called Anodizing, which&#xA0;&#x3C;span&#x3E;creates a protective coating for aluminum that prevents wear resistance, failing of threaded parts, and corrosion.&#xA0;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;They use top-of-the-line magnets and screens. The magnets they use are Neodymium Diametrically Magnetized Cylindrical Rare Earth Magnets which create a triple layer of Nickel and Copper to prevent against corrosion and abuse. Santa Cruz Shredder uses T304 Microbic Precision Woven Non-Fraying Stainless Steel Screens which has a high micron size that allows less impurities to pass through into the pollen chamber.
