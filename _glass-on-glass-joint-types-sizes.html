		<p>Glass on glass <a href="http://dankstop.com/glass-water-pipes/">water pipes</a> and <a href="http://dankstop.com/concentrate-pipes-and-dab-rigs/">dab rigs</a> contain multiple sizes and different gender types, and here at DankStop we get a lot of questions about glass on glass joints. We love constantly educating our customers on the proper terminology because we believe that informed consumers make the best decisions for their individual needs. Knowing the difference between a male and a female joint, or the difference between a 10mm and an 18mm sized joint, can lead you to making the perfect purchase.</p>

		<h2>Joint Sizes:</h2>
		
		<ul>
		    <li>
				<img src="%%ASSET_images/wiki/glass-on-glass-joint-tpes-sizes/glass-on-glass-joint-size-10mm.png%%" alt="10mm Glass on Glass Joints"/>
		        <p>10mm → 10mm joints are sometimes referred to as mini or nano joints. They are generally found on <a href="http://dankstop.com/glass-pendants/">pendant concentrate rigs</a> and other small rigs and pipes. They are the most rare of the three joint types.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
				<img src="%%ASSET_images/wiki/glass-on-glass-joint-tpes-sizes/glass-on-glass-joint-size-14mm.png%%" alt="14mm Glass on Glass Joints"/>
		        <p>14mm → 14mm joints are very prevalent throughout different sizes and brands of <a href="http://dankstop.com/glass-water-pipes/">water pipes</a> and <a href="http://dankstop.com/concentrate-pipes-and-dab-rigs/">concentrate pipes</a>.</p>

		        <p>18mm → Usually reserved for larger <a href="http://dankstop.com/concentrate-pipes-and-dab-rigs/">dab rigs</a> and <a href="http://dankstop.com/glass-water-pipes/">glass water pipes</a>, 18mm joints are also very common throughout different brands.</p>

		<h2>Joint Types:</h2>
		
		<ul>
		    <li>
				<img src="%%ASSET_images/wiki/glass-on-glass-joint-tpes-sizes/glass-on-glass-joint-type-male.png%%" alt="Glass on Glass Male Joint Types"/>
		        <p>Male → Male joints are more commonly found on vapor rigs, although they are found on water pipes as well. To properly use a male jointed glass pipe, you need to use the same sized female dome, female bowl, or female domeless nail.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
				<img src="%%ASSET_images/wiki/glass-on-glass-joint-tpes-sizes/glass-on-glass-joint-type-female.png%%" alt="Glass on Glass Female Joint Types"/>
		        <p>Female → Female joints are reserved primarily for water pipes, although in rare instances a concentrate rig that comes with a male jointed domeless nail can contain a female joint. To properly use a female jointed glass pipe, you need to use the same sized male bowl or male domeless nail.</p>
		    </li>
		</ul>

	<p>Due to the consistency of joint types, <a href="http://dankstop.com/glass-accessories-downstems-and-adapters/" title="Glass Accessories, Downstems and Adapters">glass adapters and dropdowns</a> have been created to let you interchange your glass pipe between different joint sizes as well as transforming to the other joint type. Male jointed dab rigs can be turned into female <a href="http://dankstop.com/glass-water-pipes/" title="Glass Water Pipes">water pipes</a> while female water pipes can be turned into <a href="http://dankstop.com/concentrate-pipes-and-dab-rigs/" title="Concentrate Pipes and Dab Rigs">male jointed concentrate rigs</a>.</p>
